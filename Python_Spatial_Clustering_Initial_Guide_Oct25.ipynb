        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "We reach to the final lecture of this short introducction to python. To finish I would like to present two methods that have been relevant to the spatial analysys field.\n",
        "\n",
        "## K-means and DBSCAN in Spatial Data Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main reasons for us to lead this module is to describe you why the Spatial data analysis plays an important role in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within geographical datasets. As we mentioned in the lecture there are two popular clustering algorithms, K-means and DBSCAN, are widely used in spatial data analysis for uncovering meaningful insights. Let's explore what each algorithm describe and discuss their relevance in the field.\n",
        "\n",
        "### K-means Clustering:\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a *partitioning* method that aims to group data points into 'k' clusters based on similarity (did you recall the Tobler's law?). It operates by iteratively assigning data points to clusters and updating cluster centroids until convergence. K-means is particularly useful for spatial data analysis as it helps identify spatial patterns and groupings within a dataset. It is widely applied in fields such as urban planning, crime analysis, and environmental science.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of spatial analysis, K-means can assist in identifying areas of similar characteristics, such as concentrations of certain activities or the segmentation of regions based on specific features. The method can be also be applied to multidimensional datasets and is used to applied to an introduction to spatial clustering. There are pros and cons that comes with this method, that will be covered in the advance module.\n",
        "\n",
        "### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a *density-based* clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on the density of data points in space. Unlike K-means, DBSCAN can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. It is especially valuable in spatial data analysis because it can detect clusters in regions with varying data point densities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the spatial analysis field, DBSCAN is often used to find spatial hotspots, anomalies, or areas with varying population densities. It can be effective in identifying spatial patterns that may not conform to standard geometrical shapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a good practice to try out both methods and start to compare both clustering to define where are the best results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why these methods are relevant in the Spatial Data Analysis field.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both K-means and DBSCAN are indispensable tools in the spatial data analyst's toolkit, lets enumerate three initial use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pattern Recognition:** These algorithms help recognize spatial patterns, which can be vital for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Anomaly Detection:** They can identify outliers and anomalies in spatial datasets, enabling the detection of irregularities or unexpected phenomena.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Segmentation:** Clustering aids in segmenting spatial regions based on certain characteristics, facilitating targeted analysis and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will implement **K-means** and **DBSCAN** on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing hands-on experience with spatial clustering techniques."

        "\n",
        "Our exploration into spatial clustering using the **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** algorithms has provided valuable insights into uncovering patterns within crime data in London. The visualizations created with `Plotly` and `GeoPandas` have allowed us to observe how these algorithms group spatial data points based on their geographical coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "This brief introduction to spatial clustering offers just a glimpse into the world of data-driven spatial analysis. The use of **KMeans**, a partitioning and unsupervised clustering method, and **DBSCAN**, a density-based clustering approach, also unsupervised method,  has display distinct patterns within the crime dataset. We've witnessed the power of these algorithms in identifying clusters and anomalies, offering a foundation for understanding spatial distributions. It was also relevant to see how useful using external and powerful Machine Leaning libraries like `Sklearn` can be in python, and how much  code would eventually save us.\n",
        "\n",
        "**It is important to note that spatial clustering extends far beyond the methods explored here. Statistical and spatial clustering techniques provide a diverse toolkit for researchers and analysts, enabling a deeper understanding of underlying patterns.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**If you want to continue your learning and practice into spatial data analysis, in the advance module (GG4257)** I will cover more libaries, how to install locally the python stack, and we will cover more methods that go beyond the geographic proximity, incorporating statistical measures and advanced clustering algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "As final step, now is your turn to try some of these code lines with the **Exercise notebook available in Moodle.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Aditional Note:** The library we used called lonboard https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/ and you have installed at the beinging of this notebook allow us to load much larger datasets, around 2 to 4 millons of records, something that would be nearly impossible to do it with the tradtional GIS tools and your computer as we will overpass the computational capacity in a matter of seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here in Google Colab you also have some **RAM and Disk limits**, so you probably will need to be aware of how you manipulate load big datasets in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general terms we can do plenty of analysis here, but unless we are willing to set up a credit card and pay for more cloud resources, the best way to have **full control and use more RAM or Disk resources** is installing the so-called python stack in our machines, so we can use our local resources without paying anything extra, the limit will be defined by the RAM and Disk limits on your machine."
